## About The Project

This is a Tic Tac Toe game built using Python and Pygame. It allows the player to play against the computer or against another player. The computer uses the minimax algorithm to make moves.

### Built With

1. Python
2. Pygame
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.10
2. Pygame

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the prerequisites using command pip install pygame

### Usage
When you run the program it will display an empty 3x3 board.
You will be prompted to choose your symbol, either 'X' or 'O'. The AI player will automatically take the opposite symbol.
The game will start, and you will be prompted to input the row and column where you want to place your symbol on the board. The AI player will make its move after you make your move.
The game will continue until one player wins or the board is full.
Once the game is over, the final board and the outcome of the game (win, loss, or draw) will be displayed.
Note that since the AI player is using the Minimax algorithm, it will always make the best possible move, so it may be difficult to beat.Hence you can really improve your skills.
